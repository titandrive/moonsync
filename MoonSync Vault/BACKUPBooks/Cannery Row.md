## Highlights

> [!quote]
> It was deeply a part of Lee's kindness and understanding that man's right to kill himself is inviolable, but sometimes a friend can make it unnecessary.

> [!quote]
> He can kill anything for need but he could not even hurt a feeling for pleasure.

> "The things we admire in men—kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling—are the concomitants of failure in our system.

And while men admire the quality of the first, they love the produce of the second."
