**Author:** James S. A. Corey

## Highlights

> [!quote]
> The girl's talk was as fast and meaningless as a leaking seal, and her father responded with grunts and nods at more or less appropriate moments.

> [!quote]
> Octavia Muss was originally from crimes against persons, back before Star Helix split violence up into smaller specialties. From there, she'd been on the rape squad. Then a couple of months of crimes against children. If the woman still had a soul, it had been pressed thin enough to see through. Her eyes never registered anything more than mild surprise.

> [!quote]
> Miller had seen pictures of them before; the idea of that much weight for a single megabyte of data struck him as decadent.
